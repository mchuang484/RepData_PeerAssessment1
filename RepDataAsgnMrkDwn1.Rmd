Analze personal movement activity generated by device like Fitbit, Nike, etc.  Here are the analysis that will be perform in this research.
1. What is the mean total number of steps taken per day?
2. What is teh daily acitivity pattern?
3. Imputing missing values.
4. Are there diferences in the activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

Let's Begin
Make sure you set the working directory to your data source file location. 

Loading source file and load library(dplyr) package
```{r, echo=TRUE}

activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
library(dplyr)

```

1. Calcualte mean total number of steps taken per day:

```{r, echo=TRUE}

GroupByDay <- group_by(activity, date)
MeanTotalStepsPerDay<- summarize(GroupByDay, MeanSteps = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
